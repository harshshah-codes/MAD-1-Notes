## History of Internet

#### `1890+`: Telephone Networks

- Wires occupied when only in use.
- Data transferred instead of voice

#### `1969`: ARPANet

- Node-to-Node network

#### Protocols

- Alternatively, replace each protocol with "Inter" Network protocol.

#### `1983`: IP(Internet Protocol)

#### `1983`: TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)

- Establishes reliable communications - retry, error control
- Automatically scale and adjust to network limit

#### `1985`: Domain name

- Uses names instead of IP addresses.
- Revolutionary
