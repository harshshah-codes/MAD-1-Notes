# Components of an "Application"

Each app boils down to the usage of three components, namely,

- Frontend - UI/UX or presentation of app
- Computations or server-side logic
- Storage

### Example: Email Client

**Frontend**:
Displays the list of emails along with their content.

**Computations**:
Searching an email or indexing them.

**Storage**:
Every email is stored somewhere either locally or on server.
